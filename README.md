1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EduardoXDuardo/vbank.git
    cd vbank
    ```

2.  **Configure the Database:**
    -   Ensure you have a running instance of PostgreSQL.
    -   Create a new database named `vbank`.
    -   In the `src/main/resources/` directory, rename `application.properties.example` to `application.properties`.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Model-Entity Relationship (MER)
The data model was designed with three main entities: Client, Account, and Transaction. A Client can have multiple Accounts, and an Account can have multiple Transactions, establishing one-to-many relationships.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

### Database Scripts

The scripts for creating the database schema (`ddl.sql`) and populating it with sample data (`data.sql`) are available in the `src/main/resources` folder.

<details>
<summary><b>üìú DDL Script (`src/main/resources/ddl.sql`)</b></summary>

```sql
-- DDL SCRIPT FOR VBank DATABASE
-- Generated by Hibernate

-- Step 1: Create Tables
CREATE TABLE clients (
    id bigserial NOT NULL,
    address varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    document varchar(14) NOT NULL,
    email varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    phone varchar(11) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id bigserial NOT NULL,
    account_number varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    balance numeric(38,2) NOT NULL,
    client_id bigint NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id bigserial NOT NULL,
    amount numeric(38,2) NOT NULL,
    status varchar(255) NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('PENDING','COMPLETED','FAILED','CANCELLED')),
    "timestamp" timestamp(6) NOT NULL,
    type varchar(255) NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('DEPOSIT','WITHDRAWAL')),
    account_id bigint NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Step 2: Add Unique Constraints
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS clients ADD CONSTRAINT UK_clients_document UNIQUE (document);
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS clients ADD CONSTRAINT UK_clients_email UNIQUE (email);
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS clients ADD CONSTRAINT UK_clients_phone UNIQUE (phone);
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS accounts ADD CONSTRAINT UK_accounts_account_number UNIQUE (account_number);

-- Step 3: Add Foreign Key Constraints
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS accounts
   ADD CONSTRAINT FK_accounts_to_clients
   FOREIGN KEY (client_id)
   REFERENCES clients;

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS transactions
   ADD CONSTRAINT FK_transactions_to_accounts
   FOREIGN KEY (account_id)
   REFERENCES accounts;
```

-- Insert accounts for clients
INSERT INTO accounts (id, client_id, account_number, balance) VALUES

-- Since bigserial is used, the sequence for the ID needs to be updated

## üí° Design Decisions & Architecture Highlights

This project incorporates several professional design patterns and best practices:

-   **Layered Architecture:** The project follows a clean architecture with distinct layers for Controllers (handling HTTP requests), Services (business logic), Repositories (data access), and Mappers (DTO-Entity conversions). This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and testability.
-   **Paginated Responses:** All endpoints that can return a list of resources are paginated using Spring's `Pageable` interface to ensure API performance and scalability.
-   **JPA Specifications:** Instead of simple queries, the API uses JPA Specifications for all search endpoints. This allows for clean, type-safe, and dynamic query building based on optional filter criteria.
-   **`PATCH` for Update:** The client update endpoint uses the `PATCH` HTTP method for partial updates, a more flexible and efficient approach than `PUT`.
-   **Immutability of Financial Records:** The API intentionally does not expose `UPDATE` or `DELETE` endpoints for Transactions. Once a transaction is completed, it is treated as an immutable historical record to ensure a clear and reliable audit trail, which is a critical practice in financial systems.
-   **Centralized Exception Handling:** A global `@ControllerAdvice` intercepts custom business exceptions (`ResourceNotFoundException`, `BusinessViolationException`) and validation errors (`MethodArgumentNotValidException`), providing standardized and informative JSON error responses with the correct HTTP status codes (`404`, `400`, `422`).
-   **Data Normalization:** Sensitive identifiers like CPF/CNPJ and phone numbers are stored as raw digits in the database to ensure data consistency, improve search performance, and simplify validation. Formatting is treated as a presentation-layer concern.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap & Next Steps

While the core requirements have been fully implemented, there are several potential enhancements and features that could be added in future iterations:

-   **Asynchronous Transaction Processing:** Refactor the transaction creation logic to be asynchronous. The API would create a `PENDING` transaction and publish an event to a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, or SQS). A separate consumer would process the transaction, updating its final status to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`. This would increase the API's responsiveness and resilience.
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement a security layer using Spring Security and JWT to ensure that users can only access and manage their own financial resources.
-   **Comprehensive Unit and Integration Testing:** Create tests to cover all service-layer business logic and API endpoint behaviors.
-   **Containerization and Deployment:** Create a `Dockerfile` for the application and a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate the API and the PostgreSQL database for easy deployment to a cloud environment.
